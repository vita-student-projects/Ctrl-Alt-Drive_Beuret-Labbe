# DLAV Project – Team Ctrl-Alt-Drive – Sylvain Beuret & Victor Labbe

This repository implements a deep learning model for autonomous trajectory prediction, developed for Deep Learning for Autonomous class. 

The model is an end-to-end Deep Learning Planner that predicts the future motion of an ego vehicle from RGB camera input and past motion history.

This project draws on ideas from:
- **[TransFuser (ECCV 2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15997)** – For multi-modal fusion and ResNet feature extraction.
- **[UniAD (CVPR 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00745)** – For multi-modal trajectory + confidence prediction.
- **[End-to-end Autonomous Driving: Challenges and Frontiers (IEEE 2024)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10614862)** – For system-level design insights.
